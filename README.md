# Intelligent-Bar-Counting
The project aims to automate the counting of steel rods of various diameters (8mm, 16mm, 32mm) using machine vision and image processing technologies, addressing the inefficiencies and inaccuracies associated with manual counting. Utilizing the CRISP-ML(Q) methodology, the project begins with converting videos of steel rods into images, followed by annotation and augmentation using the Roboflow tool. This preparation sets the stage for model building, where a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is employed to train on the annotated and augmented dataset, using the YOLOv8 model architecture. The training, performed on Google Colab with a Tesla T4 GPU, achieves an accuracy of around 96%, producing the best.pt weights for deployment.

Deployment leverages Streamlit to create a web application where users can upload images for rod detection and counting, with the YOLOv8 model providing accurate counts based on the trained weights. While the current system efficiently counts rods from images, future enhancements include extending the capability to process video inputs and exploring different neural network algorithms to further optimize accuracy. This project not only reduces the manual effort and error rates in steel rod counting but also aligns with the high level of automation in modern steel rolling production lines.
